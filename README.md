### LuaJIT OpenGL SDL-Based Widget Library.

[![Donate via Stripe](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-Stripe-green.svg)](https://buy.stripe.com/00gbJZ0OdcNs9zi288)<br>

I wrote this for a pure opengl gui based on an older C++ implementation.   I wrote that when there weren't many options available.

Now I'm using cimgui+luajit, but fun fact, this pure-lua library runs incredibly faster than cimgui+luajit.  So I keep it around.

### Dependencies:

- LuaJIT
- https://github.com/malkia/ufo and/or https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ffi-bindings (OpenGL, SDL)
