LuaJIT OpenGL SDL-based widget library.

You'd be better off just using imgui or glfw or librocket or something else.
I use cimgui for all my own GUI needs.
I think I only use this for its 'mouse' and 'font' classes.

### Dependencies:

- LuaJIT
- https://github.com/malkia/ufo and/or https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ffi-bindings (OpenGL, SDL)
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ext
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-gl
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/vec-lua
